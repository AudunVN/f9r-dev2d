# BaseJS

_Focus on the program, not the JS._

BaseJS is a simple and light framework for managing common JS
requirements, such as asynchronous asset or script loading.

# Variables

## `MODULES`

For each JavaScript file you'd like loaded, just add its name relative
to `assets/scripts` (minus the `.js` extension) to the `MODULES`
variable. All of your scripts should be in `assets/scripts` to
minimize confusion. If the script name is preceded with a `-` (minus)
symbol, the callbacks (`module_init()`, `module_update()`, etc.) won't
be called and it will be treated as a normal JavaScript file included
via the `<script />` tag.

The callbacks will be run in the order of the files; if you've put the
`physics` module above the `input` module, `physics_init()` will be
called before `input_init()`.

## `VERSION`

Just an array of the version of the program. It's saved in the
property tree (under `prop.version` and `prop.version_string`) for
future reference (e.g. in an about dialog or such).

## `UPDATE`

The `UPDATE` variable controls the action after the callbacks
`module_init_pre()` through `module_ready()` have been called. If
`UPDATE` is `true`, a main loop will be started (with
`requestAnimationFrame()`) and the `module_update_pre()`,
`module_update()`, and the `module_update_post()` callbacks will be
called every frame. Do not call `requestAnimationFrame()` in any
`module_update()` callback; it's called automatically when every
module has called `module_update_post()`.

## `FRAME_DELAY`

The property `prop.time.fps` is averaged over this many seconds; the
higher `FRAME_DELAY` is, the less frame rate spikes will be visible.

## `RELEASE`

If `RELEASE` is `true`, the maximum log level is `LOG_WARNING`;
otherwise, it's `LOG_DEBUG` (which logs everything).

# API

## `log(message,level)`

Logs `message` to the console; prepends `[ <level> ]`, where `<level>`
is the latter part of `level`, which can be one of the following:

* `LOG_DEBUG`
* `LOG_INFO`
* `LOG_WARNING`
* `LOG_ERROR`
* `LOG_FATAL`

For example, calling:

    log("this is a debug message",LOG_DEBUG);

would print out

    [ DEBUG ] this is a debug message

Note that none of the log levels do anything besides print out the
message (meaning `LOG_FATAL` will not do anything besides print out
`[ FATAL ] oh no, something died`).

## `time()`

Just returns the time in seconds, with millisecond
precision. Equivalent to `new Date().getTime()*0.001`.

## `s(number,single,multiple)`

If `number` is `1`, return `single`; otherwise, return `multiple`. If
`single` and `multiple` are omitted, `single` defaults to `""` and
`multiple` defaults to `"s"`. It's intended to be used as an easy way
to handle user-defined numbers and avoid the awful "You have clicked
the button 1 times!" message.

Usually used as:

    "You have clicked the button "+number.toString()+" time"+s(number)+"!"

## Callbacks

For each module (defined in the `MODULES` list above) without a `-`
before the name, there are some callbacks that are called if
there. Replace `module` in the following lists with the name of the
module (for example, `physics_init()`). These callbacks do not have to
be defined, but if they're there, they will be called at every
frame. Watch out for functions accidentally named `???_update()`.

* `module_init_pre()` is the first callback. It is called immediately
  after all scripts have been loaded and the property tree has been
  set up.
* `module_init()` is called immediately after `module_init_pre()`.
* `module_init_post()` is called immediately after `module_init()`.

After all modules have finished with the init callbacks,
`module_done()` is called. If there are any asynchronous callbacks
waiting, they are all blocking the `module_ready()` callback;
`module_ready()` will only be called after all asynchronous blocks
have been lifted with `async_loaded()`.

The callback `module_resize()` is also called at least once during
init and also every time the window changes size.

When `UPDATE` is `true`, the functions `module_update_pre()`,
`module_update()`, and `module_update_post()` will be called in that
order every frame (generally 60 frames per second).

## Asynchronous functions

If you have a module that needs to have some stuff done asynchronously
(for example, AJAX downloads), you can use the asynchronous functions.

* `async(name)` where `name` is an identifier for debugging and not
  currently used; it should usually be the modules' name. `async()`
  increments a number associated with the `name`.
* `async_loaded(name)` where `name` is still an identifier. It
  decrements the number incremented by `async()`; if the number is
  zero, that `name` is done. `async_loaded()` should be called inside
  of the AJAX callback (so it's only called when the asynchronous part
  is finished). When all asynchronous functions have called
  `async_loaded()` for each `async()` call, the `module_ready()`
  callback is issued.

# Demo modules

## `get`

The `get` module is used to get files via AJAX. Just create a new
class of type `Content()` (e.g. `new Content(options)`). The single
argument `options` expects a dictionary with the following keys:

* `url`: the URL to download the asset from
* `callback`: a function to call when the download is finished. Do not
  call `async_loaded()` within the callback for the content; `async()`
  and `async_loaded()` are automatically called by the `Content()`
  class.
* `type`: the type of file. Must be one of:
  * `json` for a JSON file (automatically parsed)
  * `string` for a plain-text file
  * `image` for an image format supported by the `<img />` tag
  * `audio` for an audio format supported by the `<audio />` tag
* `that`: a variable which the callback will see as `this`
* `payload`: anything. The callback will get `payload` as an argument.

The `callback` should be a function with the following arguments:

* `status` (either `"ok"` or `"fail"`)
* `data` the data, in the appropriate type; if the `type` was `image`,
  then `data` will be an `Image()`.
* `payload` is the optional payload, given as an argument to `Content()`.
